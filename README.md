# Book Management System
Developed a online Book Management Systems, where you can add a new book having its name, author, publication & price. This has all http verbs means you can save, delete, update & fetch book.
As of now I developed book management systems in backend & also tested with **Thunder Client** as well as in **Postman** everything is working fine. Later I will integrate with React.
Although I tried to display some content using html.

# Libraries :
- **Frame work** : mux framework
- **ORM** : gorm
