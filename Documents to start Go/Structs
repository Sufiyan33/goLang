Here, we will learn what is Structs?
---------------
	STRUCT
---------------
-> Struct is a data structure in GoLang. It is a collection of properties that are related to together.
	It is very similar to JavaScript struct or similar to Hash in Ruby language.
		Example :
		suite -> String
		value -> String
-> It is widely used in GoLang. So read it carefully.
-> Whenever you want to create a structs before that just define all the properties which structs may have.

---------------
	Create Structs 
---------------
-> Here we will create a project to understand the concept. So let's start.
-> Define a structs of type person. Here may be person have some field which we want to declare for structs.
	Example :
	Person have fields :					Person have values :
		firstName -> String						firstName -> "Sufiyan
		lastName -> String						lastName -> "Ahmad"

-> Now create person structs and it's value.
-> For this above the main function declare structs like below :
	type person struct {
		firstName string
		lastName  string
	}

	func main() {
-> There are 3 ways to assign values to struscts field :
		// way : 1
		sufi := person{"Sufiyan", "Ahmad"}
		fmt.Println(sufi)
	
		// way : 2
		name := person{firstName: "Sufiyan", lastName: "Ahmad"}
		fmt.Println(name)
	
		//way : 3
		var suf person
		suf.firstName = "Sufiyan"
		suf.lastName = "Ahmad"
		fmt.Println(suf)
		fmt.Printf("%+v", suf)
	}
